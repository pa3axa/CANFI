 The pictures are all from the first version,\
 since then I made a few changes;\
 
  LNA has now its own seprate PCB, no longer\
  part of the front panel, but fits on top.
  
  Noise source only tested to 2 Ghz still need\
  to evaluate its performance on higher frequency's
  
  The approx ENR is around 15.00 db at 1298 Mhz.
